# Wordpress.com Media Library Export
Download Your Entire WordPress.com Media Library

With this simple script, you can download your media library from your blog at wordpress.com to your PC.

Download the index.php file and upload in a temporary folder in your server (like “temp”), or you can use AMPPS.

Edit the file with a text editor, enter the filename of the Media xml file you exported from wordpress.com (eg:
“myxmlfile.wordpress.post_type-attachment.001.xml"). and run it by visiting the address where the file is,
eg http://localhost/index.php
